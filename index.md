### Day 1 - Introduction to Bonsai
- What is visual reactive programming?
- Learning your way around the Bonsai IDE
- Marble diagrams and how to read them
- How to measure and control almost anything with Bonsai
- Real-time tracking of colored objects, moving objects and contrasting objects
- Measuring behavior using voltages and a Raspberry Pi Pico device
- Data synchronization and measuring closed-loop latency

**Tutorial**: acquisition and tracking, data synchronization

### Day 2 - Closed-loop and Operant Behavior Experiments
- Sharing observable sequences
- Creating dynamic observable sequences with higher-order operators
- Conditional effects: triggering a stimulus based on video activity
- Continuous feedback: modulate stimulus intensity with speed or distance
- Choice, timeouts and conditional logic: building reaction time and Go/No-Go tasks
- Best practices for composing complex workflows

**Tutorial**: closed-loop systems, state-machines for operant tasks

### Day 3 - Reproducible research practices
- Building closed-loop virtual reality experiments with [BonVision](https://bonvision.github.io/){:target="_blank"}.
- Reproducible deployment and versioning of experiments
- Bonsai hackathon

**Tutorial**: visual environments, final projects
